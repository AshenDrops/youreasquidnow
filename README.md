Produce "You're a kid now!", "You're a squid now!" loops in any language.

Feel free to contribute, just fork and PR.

## what is this about anyway?

This repository is more of an experiment for me to try out and collect languages. It's based on the popular Nintendo game _Splatoon_, for which [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjPOSKnOftA) commercial was made. As you can hear, the phrase "You're a kid now, you're a squid now" is very prominent and therefore it has become an internet meme. This repository is dedicated to infinitely looping those two languages in any language we can find.
